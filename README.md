# KitchenAPI
Backend KitchenAPI for a job test using SpringBoot,MySql

The objective of the program was to facilitate the control over, mainly, the lunch system and for other company events.

With the authentication for a admin you are able to create/edit/delete/getAll an event(a lunch that happens everyday or unusual event) and with a normal authentication you are able to mark/unmark your attending to the event and get a list of the events available with all their info(date,title,description,list of people attending).

In this API I created a program with Basic Authentication with protected passwords,controller with basic functions(CRUD of events),MySQL db with JPA and tested the CRUD with POSTMAN.
